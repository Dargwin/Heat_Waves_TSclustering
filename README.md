# Heat_Waves_TSclustering

## Scripts in this repo

1. r_scripts/ts_clust_ovis.r: commands used to set time series clustering configurations and run the analysis.

2. r_scripts/ts_clust_comparisons.r: commands used to compare clustering results.

3. r_scripts/ts_clust_tables.r: commands used to obtain descriptive statistics for temporal clusters, e.g., onset, offset and duration of season as well as    max, mean(max) and dates of max egg counts.

4. r_scripts/ts_clust_plots.r: commands used to obtain time series and flow plots.

5. r_scripts/ts_clust_maps.r: commands used to obtain maps like study area, and distribution of ovitraps and dengue cases, RGB compositions, classification    results and, distribution of temporal clusters.

6. r_scripts/ts_clust_modeling.r: commands used to classify temporal clusters as a function of remote sensing variables by means of random forest. The file    includes validation and prediction too.

6. r_scripts/ts_clust_vs_dengue.r: commands used to analyze Dengue incidence vs proportion of pixels of different temporal clusters in each neighbourhood.

7. r_scripts/ts_chirps_lst_veg.r: commands used to import, process and plot data from CHIRPS and MODIS in order to visually compare seasons.
